### Introduction to Regression

#### 1. What is Regression?

Regression is a statistical technique used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It involves modeling the dependent variable as a function of the independent variables to predict the former based on the latter. The simplest form of regression, linear regression, fits a line through the data points that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.

#### 2. Why Do We Do Regression?

The primary reasons for performing regression analysis are:

- **Prediction**: To predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of independent variables.
- **Understanding Relationships**: To understand how changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable.
- **Identifying Trends**: To identify and quantify trends within the data.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: To test hypotheses about the relationships between variables.

#### 3. What is the Scope of Regression?

Regression has a broad scope in various fields, including:

- **Economics**: To forecast economic indicators, model consumer demand, etc.
- **Finance**: To predict stock prices, risk assessment, etc.
- **Healthcare**: To predict patient outcomes, analyze the effectiveness of treatments, etc.
- **Marketing**: To estimate sales, understand consumer behavior, etc.
- **Social Sciences**: To explore relationships between social factors and outcomes.

#### 4. What Problems Can Be Solved Using Regression?

Regression can be used to solve a variety of problems, including but not limited to:

- **Predicting Sales**: Estimating future sales based on advertising spend, seasonality, and other factors.
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculating the risk of default on loans based on borrower characteristics.
- **Price Estimation**: Determining the value of real estate properties based on location, size, and other attributes.
- **Health Outcomes**: Predicting patient recovery times based on treatment methods and patient demographics.
- **Environmental Studies**: Modeling the impact of climate variables on crop yields.

#### 5. What are the Limitations of Regression?

While regression is a powerful tool, it has several limitations:

- **Assumes Linear Relationships**: Basic linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, which may not always be the case.
- **Sensitive to Outliers**: Outliers can significantly affect the regression model.
- **Multicollinearity**: When independent variables are highly correlated, it can make the model unstable and difficult to interpret.
- **Overfitting**: Including too many independent variables can lead to a model that fits the training data well but performs poorly on new data.
- **Causation vs. Correlation**: Regression shows correlation but does not imply causation.

#### 6. When Not to Use Regression?

Regression should not be used in the following scenarios:

- **Non-linear Relationships**: When the relationship between variables is not linear and cannot be transformed to linear.
- **Non-independent Variables**: When the observations are not independent of each other, such as in time series data without proper adjustments.
- **Insufficient Data**: When the sample size is too small to provide reliable estimates.
- **Violations of Assumptions**: When the assumptions of regression (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality) are violated.

#### 7. What are the Assumptions that Should Be Made While Doing Regression?

When performing regression, the following assumptions should be considered:

- **Linearity**: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.
- **Independence**: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.
- **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals have constant variance at every level of the independent variable(s).
- **Normality**: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.
- **No Multicollinearity**: The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other.

Understanding these aspects of regression helps ensure the validity and reliability of the models we build, ultimately leading to better predictions and insights.
